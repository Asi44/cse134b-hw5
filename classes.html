            name="CSE 110" 
            subtitle="Software Engineering"

            large-img-url="assets/agile-diagram-large.jpg" 
            description="This was a really practical class that introduced me to software engineering and Agile methodologies.
                Working in a group of six, me and my team had to implement an Android app based on provided customer
                specifications. This class really challenged me to deliver a working project as part of a team."

        <class-card 
            name="CSE 120" 
            subtitle="Principles of Operating Systems"
            small-img-url="assets/hardware_software_and_operating_system-small.jpg" 
            large-img-url="assets/hardware_software_and_operating_system-lrg.jpg" 
            description="This was a challenging class that delved into 
            the principles of operating systems. Using Nachos and Java, we learnt how to implement key parts of a modern 
            operating system. It was really interesting to see how these complex systems work at a lower level."

        <class-card 
            name="CSE 134B" 
            subtitle="Web Client Languages"
            small-img-url="assets/hardware_software_and_operating_system-small.jpg" 
            large-img-url="assets/hardware_software_and_operating_system-lrg.jpg" 
            description="I learnt about core web technologies in this class, delving deep into the details of HTML, Javascript 
            CSS, web standards, frameworks and web components. The main project, creating a personal portfolio website, allowed
            me to put into practice all of the skills we learnt. "

            large-img-url="assets/hardware_software_and_operating_system-lrg.jpg" 
            description="In this class, we explored a wide range of topics to do with computer security. In order to fully 
            understand risks that come with software engineering and how to avoid writing dangerous code,
            this class challenged me to find vulnerabilities in given programs."

            description="This was my favorite lower division class as it gave me a deeper understanding about how
            modern computers actually work at a lower level. I gained an understanding of the C programming language and 
            assembly code."
