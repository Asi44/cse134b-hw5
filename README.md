Updates (Part 3 of HW 5)
1. Filler text from the biography section was removed and actual content was added
2. The previous hamburger menu icon for smaller screens was blurry, so I changed it.
3. I disliked the look of the main navigation menu, so I changed the styling to be simpler.
4. I cleaned up the CSS a little by using a CSS variable for the margin-bottoms. Some of the margins were listed with all 4 values, so I changed them to use a shortcut.
